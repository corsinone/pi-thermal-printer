This directory contains some example python scripts.

The most simple one to start with is definitely [print_helloworld.py](./print_helloword.py) which
prints simply "Hello World!" to the serial port.

The other scripts are more involved and, rather than simply sending some bytes to the serial port, they
also do some other actions.
